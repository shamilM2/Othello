# Othello
Description:
Othello is a classic two-player board game that is played on an 8x8 grid. The game is also known as Reversi, and the goal of the game is to have the majority of your colored pieces on the board at the end of the game.
The game starts with two black pieces and two white pieces placed diagonally in the center of the board. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, with the goal of sandwiching their opponent's pieces between two of their own pieces. Sandwiched pieces then flip over and become the color of the player who made the move. The game ends when the board is full or when neither player can make a move.
In this implementation of Othello, JavaScript was used as the programming language and p5.js was used to represent the board on the screen. The game allows players to make moves and see the changes in the course of the game after their moves and the computer's moves. Additionally, players can start a new game after the completion of the previous game. However, the functionality to choose who starts the game - human or computer - was not implemented due to time constraints and technical difficulties(will be described in the Conclusion part).
